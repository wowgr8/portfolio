  <h1>Cesar's Portfolio</h1>
  <P>Howdy and welcome to my portfolio! Below, you'll find links to projects I have created with <em>Epicodus's</em> guidance as well as a little bit more about myself!</P>

  <h2>These are a few projects I created so far:</h2>
  <div class="projects">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/wowgr8/Cats">Cats Website</a></li>
      <p>This one was actually co-authored with a dev team member and it's all about their cats! We used html and css to create it. </p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/wowgr8/xena-website">Xena's Website!</a></li>
      <p>This website is about my dog, <strong>Xena!</strong> Html and CSS were both used to create this website.</p>
    </ul>
