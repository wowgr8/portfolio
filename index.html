    <h1>Cesar's Portfolio</h1>
    <P>Howdy and welcome to my portfolio! Below, you'll find links to projects I have created with <em>Epicodus's</em> guidance as well as a little bit more about myself!</P>

    <h2>These are a few projects I created so far:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/wowgr8/Cats">Cats Website</a></li>
      <p>This one was actually <span class="color">co-authored</span> with a dev team member and it's all about their cats! We used html and css to create it. </p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/wowgr8/xena-website">Xena's Website!</a></li>
      <p>This website is about my dog, <strong>Xena!</strong> Html and CSS were both used to create this website.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Here are a few more projects I created at Epicodus, this time in order of completion :</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/wowgr8/hello-world">The first webpage we created!</a></li>
      <p>This page was created by using css and html. As someone who is very new to programming, this first project was a lot of fun.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/wowgr8/section-in-review-bootstrap-practice">Section in review page.</a></li>
      <p>This is the most recent practice project we worked on in class. We started getting a bit fancy here as we implemented bootstrap into our css and html.</p>

    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>My name is Cesar and I was recently displaced from my job at Simple Finance, it was a blessing in disguise as it led me to Epicodus! When I'm not working or attending Epicodus I generally like to stay busy by excersizing, playing video games, camping, and jamming on Abelton with friends! I was born in Guatemala hence the image of a Quetzal at the top of this page, fun fact!: <a href="img/moreuknow.png" alt="The more you know meme">Quetzales are Guatemala's national bird!</a></p>
